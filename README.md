News Sentiment Classifier using Machine Learning & NLP!This project automatically classifies news headlines as Good, Bad, or Neutral, which can be super useful for news monitoring, investor sentiment analysis, or social impact tracking.

What I did:

Used TF-IDF to convert news text into numerical vectors

Trained a Logistic Regression model to classify sentiment

Weakly labeled data using custom keyword rules and VADER

Evaluated using the Confusion Matrix and F1-Score Model
